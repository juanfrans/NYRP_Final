      This is a work in progress...<br><br>Through these maps and charts we attempt to analyze and compare different neighborhoods in New York City according to specific health and environmental metrics. This site serves as a tool for the <a href="https://www.nyrp.org/blog/introducing-the-haven-project-what-is-nyrp-doing-in-the-south-bronx/" target="_blank">Haven Project</a>, a collaboration between multiple organizations led by the <a href="https://www.nyrp.org/" target="_blank">New York Restoration Project</a>.

    <p class="description">
      The metrics on this first map serve to compare different neighborhoods in New York City. We used three types of measurements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Environmental, which includes tree and grass coverage, pollution (PM 2.5) levels and walking distance to recreational spaces measuring 6 acres or more.</li>
      <li>Health, including asthma rates, self-reported exercise, and percentage of overweight people.</li>
      <li>Demographics, which includes percentage of the population below the poverty line, percentage of the population younger than 18 and older than 65, and percentage of the population having attained only high-school or less.</li>
    </ul>
