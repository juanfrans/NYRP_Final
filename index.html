    <p class="description" id="intro1">
      New York Restoration Project (NYRP) is developing a master plan to renovate a network of open spaces in Mott Haven and Port Morris in the South Bronx. Once the plan is complete in Spring 2015, NYRP will fund the renovations and build them. The project aims to demonstrate measurable health and social outcomes resulting from an improved physical environment at the neighborhood scale. For example, one hypothesis is that by improving access to Randall’s Island, residents’ physical activity will increase with a correlative decrease in health care costs. As a first step, we will capture baseline health data and quality of life indicators which we will track as the project progresses.<br><br>Through the maps and charts on this site we attempt to analyze and compare different parts of New York City according to specific health and environmental metrics.

    <h3 class="chart_name">NYC OVERALL METRICS MAP</h3>
      <p class="description">The metrics on this first map serve to compare different neighborhoods in New York City. We used three types of measurements:
      </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Environmental, which include tree and grass coverage, pollution levels (PM 2.5) and walking distance to recreational spaces measuring 6 acres or more.</li>
      <li>Health, including asthma rates, self-reported exercise in the previous 30 days, and overweight percentages.</li>
      <li>Demographics, which include percentage of the population living below the poverty line, percentage of the population younger than 18 and 65 or older, and percentage of the population having attained only high-school or less.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">To view each metric click on the tabs on the upper-right-hand side.

    <h3 class="chart_name">NYC NEIGHBORHOOD METRICS CHART</h3>
    <p class="description">The chart below compares each of New York's Community Districts based on the same metrics illustrated on the map. For a list of what neighborhoods are included in each community board you can click on this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_in_New_York_City" target="_blank">link</a>. Highlighted is Community Board 1 from the Bronx, which includes the neighborhoods of Port Morris and Mott Haven (in addition to Melrose) which are the primary objects of this study.<br><br> To toggle between the different metrics click on the different circles on the top part of the graph.

    <p class="description">This detailed view of Mott Haven and Port Morris shows each environmental and demographic metric at a more detailed scale. In addition, you can see how implementing the Randall's Island Connector will change the distance to open spaces metric for the neighborhood.<br><br>To view the different metrics click on the upper-right-hand side tabs.

    <h3 class="chart_name">ABOUT THE DATA</h3>
    <p class="description">The data for this project comes from multiple sources:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Green space data: NYC Department of Parks and Recreation (data from 2010). Downloadable <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Landcover-Raster-Data-2010-/9auy-76zt" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Pollution data: Predicted raster surface of the 2 year annual average PM2.5. These are predicted surfaces generated for the purposes of comparing neighborhood average values over time, not to measure the impacts of a specific point source or an event. Courtesy of NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Bureau of Environmental Surveillance and Policy.</li>
      <li>Distance to open space: Generated using parks larger than 6 acres and a network analysis using only streets and paths available to pedestrian use.</li>
      <li>Asthma, overweight and exercise data: NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Community Health Survey (2013). Downloadable <a href="https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/SASStoredProcess/guest?_PROGRAM=%2FEpiQuery%2FCHS%2Fchsindex&year=2013" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
      <li>Age, education and poverty data: US Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 5 year estimates (2013).</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">A lot of the research in this site comes from lengthy discussions with the people involved in the Haven Project, specially Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, the Montefiore Medical Center and HealthxDesign.
